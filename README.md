## Development Mode

When Twilio credentials are not configured, the app runs in simulation mode:
- SMS messages are logged to console instead of being sent
- All other functionality works normally
- Perfect for development and testing

## Production Deployment

1. **Set environment to production:**
   ```env
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. **Use a process manager:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start server.js --name "task-tracker"
   ```

3. **Set up reverse proxy (nginx example):**
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your-domain.com;
       
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   }
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database file not found:**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

2. **SMS not sending:**
   - Check Twilio credentials in `.env`
   - Verify phone number format includes country code
   - Check Twilio account balance

3. **Port already in use:**
   - Change PORT in `.env` file
   - Or kill the process using the port

4. **Dependencies not installing:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

### Logs

- Application logs: Check console output
- SMS delivery: Check notification_log table in database
- Twilio logs: Available in Twilio Console

## Security Considerations

- Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
- Use strong Twilio credentials
- Consider rate limiting for production use
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
